If you develop scripts with this script as base, then if (when) Hexrays change something in their API, instead of fixing EVERY script out there the community can fix this script and all the user created scripts (that depends on this script) will work again. I try to have a low cognitive load. \"What matters is the amount of confusion developers feel when going through the code.\" Quote from https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive",
